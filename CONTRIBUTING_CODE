// -------------------- CONTRIBUTING CODE TO BERRYIO ------------------------

BerryIO is hosted on the GitHub project hosting and collaboration service
here: https://github.com/NeonHorizon/berryio

To contribute code to the BerryIO project you need to have a github account
and have BerryIO installed and working. Using git is quite complicated so I
have included some instructions below to help you get you started. Basically
you need to make your changes in /usr/share/berryio and put them in a git
branch and then upload them to GitHub.

The main BerryIO repository is read only so that users can be confident that
the code they find here can be trusted. To request your changes be added,
you will need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account and make
changes there, before creating a Pull Request, detailing your changes that
you would like to be included.

// Go into the BerryIO program directory, where you should make your changes
cd /usr/share/berryio/

// Make sure your RaspberryPi git settings are configured if you haven't
// done so already, be sure to change Fred Bloggs and the email address to
// your details!
sudo git config --global user.name 'Fred Bloggs'
sudo git config --global user.email 'test@test.com'

// Associate your forked version of the repository, calling it 'upstream' 
// (you may change this to anything you wish to call it). Be sure to 
// replace username with your GitHub username
sudo git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/berryio.git

// Add your changed files into the staging area
sudo git add .

// Commit your changed files. Be sure to set a sensible description of
// your changes
sudo git commit -m 'My code changes which are great'

// Push your changes to github, be sure to change upstream to the name you
// gave your remote repository earlier
sudo git push upstream master

When this is done, you should log in to your GitHub account and you should
see the changes you made in your version of the repository. To request they
are merged into the main repository, you should now create a pull request in
which you explain your changes.

If you did everything correctly I will then review your code branch
and maybe incorporate it into the next release!
