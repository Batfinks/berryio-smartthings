      Please be aware that the CPU load on a Pi will never be zero. Even viewing this page creates a small load on the Pi and as such you may notice the System Load 1, 5 and 15 minute average's increase slightly as you watch.
    </p>

    <p class="left">
      You can change how much CPU load viewing this page creates by editing the file <?=h(SETTINGS)?>system.php and adjusting the update intervals.
      The faster you update the more CPU load it creates. The defaults have been set to create minimal impact.
